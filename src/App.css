/* 
  The main content area (managed by <Routes />) will naturally fill the space 
  between Navbar and Footer due to the flex-direction: column on .App 
  and min-height: 100vh on both body and .App.
  If specific styling for the main content area is needed later (e.g., consistent padding),
  we can wrap <Routes /> in a <main> tag and style that.
